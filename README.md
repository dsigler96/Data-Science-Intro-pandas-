# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the data set that you are analyzing.  Include the link of where you obtained the data.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software to analyze the data.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

REQUIREMENTS:
Identify the two questions about the dataset on your own. You might change your questions after you explore the data further.

Write a program in any programming language using a statistics library (e.g. R or Python Pandas) to analyze the dataset and provide an answer to your questions.

You must demonstrate the ability to do one or more of the following to achieve each answer: filter, sort, aggregate (sum, average, count), or data conversion.

While there is no right or wrong answer, your answer should be justified by your analysis.
